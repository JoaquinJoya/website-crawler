# Debug Guide for Missing Pages Issue

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Increased Timeouts**
- **Overall crawl timeout**: 60s → 5 minutes
- **HTTP client timeout**: 15s → 30s  
- **TLS handshake**: 5s → 10s
- **Per-page timeout**: Added 30s timeout per page

### 2. **Better Rate Limiting**
- **Rate limiting interval**: 10ms → 100ms (less aggressive)
- **Per-page context**: Each page gets its own timeout context

### 3. **Comprehensive Debugging**
- **Console logging**: See exactly what's happening in terminal
- **Page counting**: Atomic counter tracks all processed pages
- **Error tracking**: All errors and panics are logged
- **Completion stats**: Shows "X/Y pages processed"

### 4. **Improved Error Handling**
- **Panic recovery**: Prevents one bad page from stopping others
- **Context cancellation**: Proper handling of timeouts
- **Client disconnection**: Detects when browser closes tab

## How to Debug

### 1. **Check Terminal Output**
When you run the crawler, watch the terminal for messages like:
```
Successfully sent page 1/19: https://example.com/page1
Successfully sent page 2/19: https://example.com/page2
Context cancelled for https://example.com/page3
Error sending page https://example.com/page4: broken pipe
Crawling completed: 17/19 pages processed
```

### 2. **Check Browser Network Tab**
- Open Developer Tools → Network tab
- Look for `/stream-crawl` request
- See if it's still receiving data or if it stopped early

### 3. **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Issue**: Some pages timeout
- **Solution**: Pages that take >30s will timeout (this is normal for very slow pages)

**Issue**: Client disconnection
- **Solution**: Don't navigate away or close tab during crawling

**Issue**: Rate limiting too aggressive
- **Solution**: Now set to 100ms between requests (was 10ms)

### 4. **Expected Behavior Now**

✅ **Good**: "✅ Crawling completed! Successfully processed all 19 pages."  
⚠️ **Partial**: "⚠️ Crawling completed with issues: 17/19 pages processed."

## Test Your Site

1. Start the crawler: `./web-crawler`
2. Open `http://localhost:8080`
3. Enter your hisonrisa URL
4. Watch the terminal output to see what's happening
5. Check the completion message for final stats

The system now provides full visibility into what's happening with each page!
